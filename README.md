# yepiwantthis.com

An Amazon affiliate website written in Go using
the [Amazon product advertising API](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html).
It was available at [yepiwantthis.com](http://yepiwantthis.com) for a short time.

The website got rejected by Amazon (more info on
[my blog](http://www.mirovarga.com/my-amazon-affiliate-experiment-a-sequel)) so
I decided to host the source code on GitHub to be able to demonstrate my Go
skills when applying for Go projects.


## What it does

Just run it and see for yourself :)

```
$ go get github.com/dominicphillips/amazing
$ go get github.com/kennygrant/sanitize
$ go get github.com/gorilla/mux
$ go get github.com/gosimple/slug
```
```
$ go run website.go amazonstore.go store.go
```

Now open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.


## How it works

The products are stored in the `amazonstore.json` file and loaded into memory on
start. The file was generated by running the `amazonstore_test.go` test (it
doesn't work anymore because I removed the API credentials). The file was last
generated on March 27, 2015.

The website uses just one [html/template](http://golang.org/pkg/html/template/)
template.
